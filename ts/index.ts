/*

  Things I gotta do:

  * load package.jsons, and render them with elm-static-html or something
    similar. Ideally ask Elm to tell me all of the metadata I need, too.
  * write out the sqlite database with the docs
  * write out the final HTML and sqlite db to the format dash expects

  Stretch goals for the hack day:

  * build local documentation (allow this to be configured somehow?)

console.log("hello, world");
